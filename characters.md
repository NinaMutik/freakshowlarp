Every one of the characters, except the outsiders, are in the Freak Show because they have no other option. Even the ones who are not visibly different have something that sets them aside from normal society. Some of them may have made themselves different on the outside too though they weren’t like that to start with. The freaks are the misfits, unable to live by the norm. Some of them might be there because their loved ones can’t fit the norm.

All of the characters have reacted differently to being an outcast. Some still wish for a normal life and their emotions are conflicted. Some would not live any other way and have found a family and a home. Some like causing disgust and interest in normals, some hate it.

There are three distinct groups of characters:
The Freaks, who have some clearly visible factor that makes them unfit to normal society. They are the star performers.
The Circus Folk, who travel and work with the circus, but are not visibly different. All of them are not performers, but all are somehow not normal.
The Outsiders, these are people currently travelling with the circus, but who can go back to society if they choose so.
