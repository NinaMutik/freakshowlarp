The world of the Freak Show is more unaccepting than the one we live in. Different people face every day violence, neglect, despise and ridicule. It is a widely accepted unspoken norm that different people are of less value than the normal ones and can be treated inhumanely. 

In Freak Show’s world normal is defined narrowly. You are either a healthy, caucasian, monogamous heterosexual, man or a woman, and act and look just like everyone else, or you are a freak.

## What is a Freak Show?

The freaks have resorted to the only thing they can to survive. They have changed their difference into a business. The freaks have created a safe harbor for themselves, a place outside the rules and troubles of normal society where they can live and thrive. The freaks are selling their otherness and also an entrance to a magical place outside the norm. The normal people can gawk at them, be horrified, be awed, be entertained or maybe even explore what is usually impossible for them. The Freak Show is an unplace, outside normal and thus magic by nature.

To the freaks the Freak Show is a family. They have no other place to go to nor anyone else to stand up for them. The freaks look out for each other and are loyal to each other. Inside the Freak Show’s area they feel safe. 
To the normals the freaks are safely contained in the space they have created, a small separate world the normals can endure and visit for entertainment. Therefore to the freak family the Freak Show is also freedom. In the Freak Show they can be what they are without hiding. They have jurisdiction and power over this small place they have made for themselves.

Since the Freak Show is outside normal and it also feels like a place where everything might be possible. There is constantly magic in the air when normal rules don’t apply. The freaks are very superstitious and all have their own magic and tales to tell. The fabric between real and unreal is thin and easily crossed.
