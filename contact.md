## Who is organising Freak Show?

That would be us!


### Simon Brind

### Dominika Cembala

### Alessandro Giovannucci

Alessandro is an academic lecturer and larp designer, one of the founders of Chaos League and co-author of Southern Way - New Italian LARP manifesto, as well as organizer of international high-budget games (Black Friday, New Atlantis) and LARP festivals (Play Larp). In the Freak Show he works with writing characters and plot.


### Martin Olsson

Martin is from Sweden, and started larping in the early 90s. As an organiser he's been involved in some Swedish classics, such as Det Sista Kapitlet, Hamlet Inifrån, and Skyrmion.


### Nina Teerilahti

Nina is a 37 year old Finnish artist, comic artist, illustrator, graphic designer and a trained producer.

Nina is enthusiastic about larp as an art form and has been active in the international scene since 2014. She has co-organized two international larps in Finland and played games all around Europe. All Nina’s art is very strongly story and emotion driven and larp is by far the strongest media to convey stories and emotions she has encountered. Best stories are shared and created together.

As a larp creator Nina is all about creating immersion and strong emotions. She aims at creating cathartic experiences for the players to dive into.
