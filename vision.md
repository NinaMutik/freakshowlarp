When I saw the thrill and joy ignite in his eyes it was freedom. We were outside everything, law, society and all things normal. Suddenly there was no one to define us, judge us or get offended by our existence and we were free. The twilight in the run down, abandoned amusement park seeped with tragedy, magic and wonder. We ran and laughed. It seemed like the place was telling us that the terrible price of true freedom is abandonment. The moment moved me deeply. It resonated with a hidden truth in beautiful emotions. I knew I had to share this junction point of truth and human experience.

This is why I am creating a Freak Show LARP in an abandoned amusement park in Finland. I want to create a story of otherness, hope, being outcast from society, love, freedom and magic in the romantic gothic horror genre.

The project is a leap of faith, as all good things are. I started to talk about it and saw that the idea resonated with community. I gathered an international, experienced crew to create this with me. Now all that I am missing are the people playing the roles in this story, the 45 co-creators I need to make this dream come true. I will not call the participants players, because this is not a game, not a problem to solve, not something to win. This is a unique, once in a lifetime experience we will create together. This will move us and change us.

I need you to give this all you’ve got to create a journey we will never forget.

So, what kind of a freak are you?

<img src="assets/images/strange.gif" class="image left" alt="Strange Rotations"/> When talking about a LARP, it seems strange to start with a description of what it is not. However with a thematically challenging LARP like this, we wanted to be clear up-front about the intentions and the design choices behind the game.  The title, “Freak Show” is emotive.  We could have called it “Side Show” or “Carnivale” (after the popular television series), but this would have occluded the dialogue we need to have.  

In her book, Sideshow U.S.A. - Freaks and the American Cultural Imagination, Rachel Adams suggests that the freak can serve as a metaphorical construct that allows the audience to interrogate ‘the other;’ whether the question is about race, empire and immigration, gender or disability.

We acknowledge that the choice is controversial. There are other fictional metaphorical constructs that can enable similar discourse; but these are not steeped in our own cultural history and the distance becomes significant.

This LARP is not a comedy. It will not make amusement out of real life tragedy or disability.  This LARP is also not about laughing at different people; it is not about reinforcing stereotypes or about ableism, transphobia or racism.

Instead the Freak Show is a story of people living outside the norm - The Others.  The game will explore what it is to be rejected by society. It is a romantic, gothic story of the last days of a traveling circus. The Freak Show aims to take players on a cathartic journey.  

The LARP will deal with some dark themes, but it will also be filled with compassion and love. In our game the freaks stand together.
