“We didn't lie to you folks. We told you we had living, breathing monstrosities. You laughed at them, shuddered at them. And yet, but for the accident of birth, you might be one as they are. They did not ask to be brought into the world. But into the world they came. Their code is a law unto themselves: offend one and you offend them all.” (Carnival Barker, Freaks, 1932)

When talking about a LARP, it seems strange to start with a description of what it is not. However with a thematically challenging LARP like this, we wanted to be clear up-front about the intentions and the design choices behind the game.  The title, “Freak Show” is emotive.  We could have called it “Side Show” or “Carnivale” (after the popular television series), but this would have occluded the dialogue we need to have.  

In her book, Sideshow U.S.A. - Freaks and the American Cultural Imagination, Rachel Adams suggests that the freak can serve as a metaphorical construct that allows the audience to interrogate ‘the other;’ whether the question is about race, empire and immigration, gender or disability.

We acknowledge that the choice is controversial. There are other fictional metaphorical constructs that can enable similar discourse; but these are not steeped in our own cultural history and the distance becomes significant.

This LARP is not a comedy. It will not make amusement out of real life tragedy or disability.  This LARP is also not about laughing at different people; it is not about reinforcing stereotypes or about ableism, transphobia or racism.

Instead the Freak Show is a story of people living outside the norm - The Others.  The game will explore what it is to be rejected by society. It is a romantic, gothic story of the last days of a traveling circus. The Freak Show aims to take players on a cathartic journey.  

The LARP will deal with some dark themes, but it will also be filled with compassion and love. In our game the freaks stand together.
