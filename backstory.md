The three decades running up to the last days saw the world change.  Like some biblical apocalypse, rulers became more inclined to look after the interests of the rich, the white, and the already powerful.  At the same time they were less willing to look after the sick or unfortunate.  There we no jobs to go around.  The foreigner, or the stranger became The Enemy; somehow they were to blame for everything that went wrong.  All the meek inherited was culpability.

_The Norman Sisters Freak Show and Circus_ is a traveling show put together from a mixed bag of people that the sisters have gathered together. Some of them they have saved from the streets, from orphanages, or from mental hospitals and asylums. Some freaks have come to them or joined from other traveling groups.

Sometimes a person or two leaves the town with them, these are the folk, who - for many reasons - have chosen to run away to join the circus.

But the time of traveling carnivals, circuses, sideshows and freaks shows is already gone. It’s impossible to compete with all the other entertainment available. The Sister’s group is the last of them. Joined by refugees from the other freak shows they’ve been on The Road for a lifetime, or more ...

Our LARP starts with a bunch of freaks and circus folk, a bunch of mixed souls all in hock to The Devil.  They could find a place here, somewhere to call home.  A stable base from which to grow and operate.  A way back into a society that hates the outsider almost as much as it hates itself.  But with any deal with the Devil, the price is always too high and the deal you get is not the one you thought you made.


And so the circus has a home.  A chance.  A hint of hope.  But half the living souls in the circus belong to The Devil now, and at Halloween he’s coming to take payment…

The Freak Show has come to town, and the town ain’t happy.

“We have to move again,” The older sister sighed.

“Surely not, we’ve barely been here a week!” said the doctor.

“I’m afraid so,” the sister continued, her sigh was like the blowing wind, and the tent blew back, “There’s been muttering and murmuring in the town.  I hear they’re gonna come and try to burn us out.  You know I can’t abide a fire.  And everything is so dry; the lot would go up in black smoke and then where would we be.  Without a roof over our heads and winter fast approaching.”

“But we don’t have a roof over our heads now,” the tattooed man whined, his voice was thin, like a woodwind instrument with an old reed, “we ain’t got nowhere to go.”

“What do you want, Clam,” said the younger sister, “I can’t magic up a place where we can be ourselves, where we can be free.  You know I would if I could.  Hell, I’d give anything for a place we could call our own.”

Anything?  Hell?

It was two months later, as they ended the worst traveling season in ten years on the road, that The Beautiful Man appeared.  In a convoy full of freaks he stood out.  He was symmetrical, toned, tall.  He smelt of roses and his eyes were the colour of the sunrise.  And his smile … his smile stole you away, heart and soul.  He said his name was “Lou,”  but these being circus folk and with a fondness for giving people a new name, they called him “Angel.”

“I know a place,” he told the sisters, “it lies a long way from here.  But it is a place where you can find a home.  A place you can settle down.  A place you can be yourselves.  It can be yours.”

“We ain’t got enough money to last the winter, Angel, we can’t afford no home,” said the elder sister, “we can barely afford to feed the horses, and the Lions are looking mighty peaky with not enough meat to go around.”

“But this won’t cost you a cent,” he told them, “it ain’t that kind of contract; not that kind of contract at all.”

“So, what will it cost?” asked the younger sister …
