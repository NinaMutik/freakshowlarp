        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>The site of the game is Wasalandia amusement park in the city of Vaasa in Finland and a nearby camping area, Top Camping Vaasa. The site is a 5 to 6 hour drive from the capital Helsinki. Helsinki is most likely the cheapest airport to fly to.</p>
        <p>Note that these pictures are old and from the time that the park was still open to public. It is a bit different now.</p>
        <p>We will arrange an optional shared bus to the site and back from Helsinki Airport.</p>

Rain is likely and the site is by the sea so there will be wind. Dress warm and to shelter you from the wind and possible rain. Plan your costume and props with this in mind. The sleeping cabins have heating, but the other game areas don’t.</p>

<h3 id="accommodation">Accommodation</h3>

<p>The cabins spaces are quite tight and there is a 10cm door step to get in. The beds are bunk beds, but some cabins have a double bed  and one bunk bed instead and those can be used if they make using the cabin easier.</p>
