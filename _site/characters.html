<p>Read through the roles listed here. When you’ve chosen one or more roles you like, go ahead and <a href="apply.html">apply to take part!</a>. The roles are quite open to interpretation and we will work together with you to flesh them out. Some of the roles have <strong>special requirements</strong> in the form of makeup, props or other preparations. Information about these requirements are listed with the character.</p>

And never heard from your parents. Just the same way as you never hear from those, who make fun of the other freaks, your true Family. You were lost in the world. Your body is covered with feathers. Wearing clothes wasn't the easiest task, as only sliding them off was straight forward, not putting them on, and you couldn't walk around naked. Your real mom called you a curse, a punishment, but then you found these people and they are something totally different. Still, sometimes someone unkind comes, and you share with them some magic. Just like with mom. Some can take more, some other can't. They have sweet dreams before they go, you think. You learned, that you can go to great lengths for the Family.</div>

                            Anything can be fixed. People are born and die, things don’t. You work with your hands, you know the truth. There is a special connection. “Ordinary people” didn’t understand you. They treat you as a fool, with all your ideas about life and dead. This is the reason why you join the circus. Sometimes you try to explain your believes to people, sometimes you realize how useless it is and prefer being just Fix, the handyperson.

                            You could sell snow to the penguins, but it ain’t worth it because those little bastards don’t have any money. It isn’t fair that other people have everything and you got nothing. So you sell them a miracle cure that you cook up in your caravan. Two parts paraffin to three parts herbs and spin. This stuff seems to work though. People come back time and time again for more of it. Maybe one day you’ll make it rich?

                            You are Little Sister’s daughter and they both are your parents. You grew up in the Freak Show and are now becoming a woman. This seems to frighten your mothers for some reason. You despise the normals, they don’t know what means to be free. You try to show them as often as you can, so that their life could be better too. You don’t think they are dangerous, just stupid.

                            The road to rock and roll is the road to ruin. It was fun for a while. Life on the road.  A new town every night.  Tourbus ‘romance’ - a new conquest every night.  Sex, rock’n’roll and drugs…  The first time you had it was like God’s own embrace; the heat of the stuff burning through your veins and into your heart.  Now the music is just a way to take away the pain until it is time for the next fix. At least here in the freak show you’ve got a ready supply of junk. Playing tunes and counting the hours down to the next hit.
