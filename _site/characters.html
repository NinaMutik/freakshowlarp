			<p><p class="lead">You are in the Freak Show because you have no other option. Even if you’re not visibly different, there is something that sets you aside from normal society. Maybe you made yourself different on the outside too even though you weren’t like that to start with.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/barnum-bailey.jpg" class="image fit" alt="Barnum Bailey Gang" /></p>

<p>Read through the roles listed here. When you’ve chosen one or more roles you like, go ahead and <a href="apply.html">apply to take part!</a>. The roles are quite open to interpretation and we will work together with you to flesh them out. Some of the roles have <strong>special requirements</strong> in the form of makeup, props or other preparations. Information about these requirements are listed with the character.</p>

You drink too much and everyday the problems of a nomadic life become a little harder. But at night, in your dreams, the solution is right before you. You just forget what it is when you wake up. The answer lies with the freak show, you know it in your heart.

Animals love you, they do what you want them to. But they keep dying. Right now you have no animals, so no act, and the circus folk look at you like it is your fault. The Freaks, well they are more complex than your animals, but some of them are almost as helpless; after all, you are only complete when you have something to look after.

Playing tunes and counting the hours down to the next hit.

                            You have fasted in the flowering deserts of Oman living only on scent and you have listened to the silence of the gurus in India. At least that’s what you tell them, as you suggestively wave your cheap amulet. They usually play along, but recently it has been turning strange. Maybe it’s true what they say about magic getting stronger in the end times. You sense that this place and time makes your hypnosis deeper and truer, and your desires clearer. You have always needed more, searched for something deeper, that much at least is true.

                            People see these folk are freaks, but you don’t get that; you can’t see them – see. Some folks say that those who can’t see often hear more to compensate. That’s kind of true, but on the whole it is a load of bull. Cataracts turned the world to mist and now you see shapes, outlines. What you hear is the music. There is jazz and syncopation and sometimes what you call “a strange melody.” The circus has this music playing; it comes from the people in it, and they give the world of mist a colour and soul.

And since then you quote various horoscopes to them and walk away with a focused expression. But really, it’s not even worth a handful of ash. Being able to do real magic would be so great, you would do anything to have real powers.
