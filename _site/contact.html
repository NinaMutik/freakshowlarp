    <h2 id="simon-brind">Simon Brind</h2>

    <p>Simon is a British writer and academic. He has been a larper since 1986 and in that time he has designed and written for all manner of games, larps, and performances. The smallest was for one player, the largest for thousands.</p>

    <p>Simon’s passion is for stories in larp that manifest organically and how they seem to be both ephemeral and eternal at the same time. He secretly believes they might be literally magic.</p>

    <p>As a larp writer Simon’s primary interest is how to balance the storyteller’s art with both player and character agency. He specialises in plot actuation, and dramaturgy in times of narrative chaos. His favourite larps are ones that create powerful emotions, military grade bleed, and memories that last forever.</p>

    <h2 id="nina-teerilahti">Nina Teerilahti</h2>

    <p>Nina is a 37 year old Finnish artist, comic artist, illustrator, graphic designer and a trained producer.</p>

    <p>Nina is enthusiastic about larp as an art form and has been active in the international scene since 2014. She has co-organized two international larps in Finland and played games all around Europe. All Nina’s art is very strongly story and emotion driven and larp is by far the strongest media to convey stories and emotions she has encountered. Best stories are shared and created together.</p>

    <p>As a larp creator Nina is all about creating immersion and strong emotions. She aims at creating cathartic experiences for the players to dive into.</p>
