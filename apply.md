The Freak Show has pre-written characters that are unique and complex. We want to match them wit active and passionate participants. We want to assign to you the role that fits you the best, the one that can stimulate you the most.

Signing up will be open at 12:00 UTC on 23rd of February and will be open until March 13th.

We will cast the characters based on motivational letters. The casting process will be anonymized, which means we won’t know the name of the player requesting a character. We aim to complete casting by the end of March.

## Fill up the signup form

For your FIRST CHOICE of character please answer the following questions:

- Why do you want to play this character?
- How will you make this character unique and alive?
- How would you develop this character further?

We are looking for co-creators so our advice is to be _creative_ and _passionate_.

Every character’s description proposes several leads and possibilities, some will be developed, some will not, is up to you.
Add your personal touch. Delight us! We want you and your unique ideas.
