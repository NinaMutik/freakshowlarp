Every character in this LARP is unique and complex. We want to match them with
active and passionate participants. We want to assign to you the role that fits you the best, the one
that can stimulate you the most. Freak Show will be co-created experience and we need you to make it happen.

Signing up will be open at 12:00 UTC on 23rd of February and will be open until March 13th.

This LARP uses pre-written characters. You can read all about our freaks and folks here: [Characters](/characters.html)


We will cast the characters based on motivational letters. The casting process will be anonymized, which means we won’t know the name of the player requesting a character. We aim to complete casting by the end of March.
