<h4><span style="margin-top:200px;font-size:172px;line-height: 0px;display: block;">“</span>We didn't lie to you folks. We told you we had living, breathing monstrosities. You laughed at them, shuddered at them. And yet, but for the accident of birth, you might be one as they are. They did not ask to be brought into the world. But into the world they came. Their code is a law unto themselves: offend one and you offend them all.”<br>
&mdash; Carnival Barker, Freaks, 1932</h4>
