The purpose of magic in this game is to generate play and to extend the story.  It is diegetic, opt in, and designed to increase rather than break immersion.

It is not intended to be a solution to plot, but rather a thematic device to extend play and develop the gothic/magical setting of the larp.


It works because it is the End of Days.  It is stronger in liminal spaces, like the circus, and strongest for those who live outside of the norm, like the freaks.

It should not be commonplace.  Some characters can do magic, but it should be used sparingly.  There is a price for magic and the price is always too high.

Magic is ‘opt-in’ the recipient of the magic decides whether or how it works.  We will brief our NPCs accordingly

Magic only works if people see it.  You can’t do magic ‘behind someone’s back’.


## Types of magic

### Fortune Telling

By use of the tarot cards or a crystal ball or other divining techniques, some characters can tell the future.  If your future is told then you, as a player, may choose to play towards this future.  For example, if you are told you will fall in love and then lose that love, then you may choose to take your character in that direction.  

### Enhancing

With this kind of magic when you add it to something it becomes briefly better.  For example if you add it to food, the food becomes the most delicious food, if you add it to a performance, the performance becomes amazing.  HOWEVER there is a price for this.  For example, the delicious food will cause horrible stomach problems, the amazing performer will get injured etc.  The recipient of the enhancing magic decides what the negative effect will be.

### Curses

Similar to fortune telling, the recipient of a curse may choose to suffer some form of bad luck or injury or emotional distress.  If they do decide to play the effects of the curse, the person who curses them will suffer some kind of backlash.  

### Ritual

Characters with ritual magic are able to have a bigger effect.  However in order to perform a ritual they require the support and assistance of other characters (those ‘without’ magic of their own.)  All of the participants will pay a price for the magic, and they must specify what this price will be as a part of the ritual.  Often this takes the form of emotional pain, lost memories, or curses taken upon themselves.

Rituals often have a gritty religious epicness - like voodoo - and often reference God and The Devil.  The recipient or target of a ritual must be aware of it.  For example the traditional ritual to bring audiences to the circus that the freak show performs in each new town takes the form of a parade through the town; the townspeople ‘see it’ (although they are not aware it is magic.)
