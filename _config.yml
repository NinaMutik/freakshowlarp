email: freakshowlarp@gmail.com
description: Freak Show is a larp held in an abandoned amusement park in Finland in
  September 2017. It tells the story of the last freak show and explores otherness
  through a romantic gothic horror setting. A family of outcasts and freaks struggle
  to survive in a hostile world. In the end, as the last song fades away, the devil
  will come to take them all to perform for him forever.
