title: El Scirocco the Flatulist
position: 19
role: Flatulist and make up artist
affinity: Circus
description: You are a very serious artist and you don’t understand why they always
  laugh. Your interpretation of Debussy’s “Clair de Lune” is a thing of fragile and
  intense beauty. Why don’t they recognise true genius when they hear it? A serious,
  strange child, you were always an outsider by choice, following your own sense of
  beauty. You found it in this family of monsters. Your see beauty everywhere, that
  is your gift. Sometimes you can make the audience see it too, and then they don’t
  laugh but sense the wonder.
requirements: No sense of shame (we will provide a soundtrack), some make up tools
  and skills
