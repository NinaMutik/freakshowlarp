title: Atlas
role: Cleaner
affinity: Circus
description: You were the best strong man of them all, but hurt your back years ago
  and couldn’t perform anymore. Still, you never could leave the circus, you couldn’t
  marry a woman and live a lie. Now you are the cleaner and keep everything tidy.
  You may be outcasts, but you’re not living like pigs. You also tend to take care
  of the young and lost ones, who remind you of yourself when you were younger.
