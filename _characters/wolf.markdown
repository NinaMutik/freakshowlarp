image: assets/images/wolf_small.jpg
description: The Lord moves in the most mysterious of ways. You were abandoned as
  a baby, feared by everyone in the village.  And so the boy with the face of a wolf
  who nobody wanted was taken in and raised by the Catholic church far to the South.  How
  could you repay their kindness but to take a vocation and enter the Church as a
  priest.  They were never going to give you a parish.  Sent first to Africa and then,
  after many long years, to the north where you found a flock, found a parish at last,
  here â€¦ in the circus.
requirements: Much facial hair, dog like prosthetic, or pronounced, wolf-life canine
  teeth.
