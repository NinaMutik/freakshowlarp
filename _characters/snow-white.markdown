title: Snow White
position: 45
role: Albino
affinity: Freaks
description: Sun can kill you. Since your birth youâ€™ve preferred to stay in a corner,
  observing. Maybe is because hiding and staying protected is vital for you. You learned
  that hearing is better than speaking, that observing is better than to be observed.
  Sometimes you speak, you act. But you are the silent sentinel of the freak show.
  In the tent you expose yourself to the audience to get food for the family, it is
  the worst thing in the world; the gaze of the audience burns like sunlight.  You
  do this for the good of the group, to bring in money for the show, but it does you
  harm.
requirements: looking like an albino, clothes with a hood
