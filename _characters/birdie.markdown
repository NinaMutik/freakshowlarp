title: Birdie
affinity: Freaks
role: Magic Dust Seller
description: You were born outside the Circus with a body covered with feathers. You
  escaped, moved away, ran as soon as it was possible. And never heard from your parents.
  Just the same way as you never hear from those, who make fun of the other freaks,
  your true Family. You were lost in the world. Your body is covered with feathers.
  Wearing clothes wasn't the easiest task, as only sliding them off was straight forward,
  not putting them on, and you couldn't walk around naked. Your real mom called you
  a curse, a punishment, but then you found these people and they are something totally
  different. Still, sometimes someone unkind comes, and you share with them some magic.
  Just like with mom. Some can take more, some other can't. They have sweet dreams
  before they go, you think. You learned, that you can go to great lengths for the
  Family.
requirements: feathery costume / prop-glue feathers to skin
