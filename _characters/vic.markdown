description: Choosing is overrated. Black and white distinctions are for limited people.
  They blame you since your birth, because you don’t want to choose a clear identity.
  You are different, you are a challenge to what the people pretend to know. And  so
  what? They don’t like you? Ok let’s test their limits make them shocked. It’s funny,
  liberating. But sometimes it hurts, sometimes is a too much heavy burden. Maybe
  one day you will stop, and try to live an ordinary life. Being always the rebel
  is consuming you.
