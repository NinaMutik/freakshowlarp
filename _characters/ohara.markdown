title: O’Harah
role: Musician
affinity: Circus
description: There is no instrument like it you know. That thing you have spent your life playing, it’s alive. You can hear it singing, even when you finish playing it. You knew even then that you’d give anything to play that music. You gave your future; signed it away at the crossroads in blood just as sure as if you’d put your neck in a noose and stepped up on a scaffold. Ten years, making the world dance, and now your time is nearly up. You gotta pay your debt, or find someone to pay it for you.
requirements: A musical instrument and skills to play it
