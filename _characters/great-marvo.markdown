description: You could sell snow to the penguins, but it ain’t worth it because those
  little bastards don’t have any money. It isn’t fair that other people have everything
  and you got nothing. So you sell them a miracle cure that you cook up in your caravan.
  Two parts paraffin to three parts herbs and spin. This stuff seems to work though.
  People come back time and time again for more of it. Maybe one day you’ll make it
  rich?
