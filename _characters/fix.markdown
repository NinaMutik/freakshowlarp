title: Fix
affinity: Circus
role: Handyperson
description: Anything can be fixed. People are born and die, things don’t. You work
  with your hands, you know the truth. There is a special connection. “Ordinary people”
  didn’t understand you. They treat you as a fool, with all your ideas about life
  and dead. This is the reason why you join the circus. Sometimes you try to explain
  your believes to people, sometimes you realize how useless it is and prefer being
  just Fix, the handyperson.
requirements: being a little bricoleur
