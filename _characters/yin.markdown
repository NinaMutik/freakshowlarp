title: Yin
position: 10
role: Clown
affinity: Circus
description: You were born to be a clown. Your grandparent's grandparents were clowns.
  When you are on stage you are alive. Everybody loves clowns. Your life was just
  perfect, but you screwed everything. Sooner or later the truth will come out. Waiting
  for the shit to hit the fan, you tend to be depressive. You drink too much and everyday
  the problems of a nomadic life become a little harder. But at night, in your dreams,
  the solution is right before you. You just forget what it is when you wake up. The
  answer lies with the freak show, you know it in your heart.
