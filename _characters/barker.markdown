title: Barker
role: Animal keeper
affinity: Circus
description: All you ever wanted was a puppy to call your own. One followed you home from school once, but your uncle drowned it in the canal. So you ran away and joined the circus. Animals love you, they do what you want them to. But they keep dying. Right now you have no animals, so no act, and the circus folk look at you like it is your fault. The Freaks, well they are more complex than your animals, but some of them are almost as helpless; after all, you are only complete when you have something to look after.
