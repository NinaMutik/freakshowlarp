role: The missing link
affinity: Freaks
description: You can read the 23 tome Encyclopedia Britannica in a day and remember
  about 80% of the content. Your appearance, however, belies the knowledge within
  as you look like a crossover of an ape and a man. They named you the missing link.
  You had fingers pointed at you, shunned and ridiculed. You learned a response that
  was easiest to understand - violence. The problem is that as you get violent, you
  are starting to forget things. If this carries on you fear you will lose your brains
  and perhaps you will end up nothing more than an ape?
requirements: Neanderthal look or prosthetics, having a stage act
