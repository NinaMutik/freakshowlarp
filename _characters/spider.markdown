title: Spider
position: 40
role: Conjoined twin
affinity: Freaks
description: You are fascinated by the macabre and gothic. Your interests include
  ancient funeral rites, taxidermy, and terrible jokes in which ordinary folk die
  in horrible Darwinian accidents. You drink too much and are prone to excess in every
  possible way. With Mabel you are as close as twins will ever be and your love is
  all encompassing. But you argue and fight terribly sometimes; sometimes you wish
  you were alone.
requirements: You are joined to (Mabel)(#mabel) at the hip, you will need to play
  together in a harness and shared clothes and perform an act on stage together.
