role: Assistant
affinity: Circus
description: You were once a champion knife thrower. The best. One day, when performing
  your blindfolded knife throwing act, you missed and killed her instantly. You lost
  your nerve and developed a stutter and tremors. Circus is all that you've known,
  the ring was your friend, and now all you can do is help others solve their problems.
  But you still remember her voice and smile. Yet should you, since another smile
  is making your day seem this bit brighter? Maybe new love will bring the edge back
  and you will be able to perform again?
